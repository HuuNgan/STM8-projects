Note:
	This program is working with CONTINOUS MODE, 
	so any function in while(1) cannot be run correctly or even no running!
	It's better to put your code with timers.

	You can use SINGLE MODE for running functions in while(1).
	Then you have to call ADCx_StartConversion() for every time you want to read ADC value.
